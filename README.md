# Build Your Own Cheatsheet

This project is my solution to **Codecademy's Build Your Own Cheatsheet** (Web Development Fundamentals).

## Objectives

**Codecademy Project Goal:** 
"In this project, youâ€™ll be building your own reference cheat sheet to help you build more websites in the future! Although there are great places to learn HTML & CSS like Codecademy, the best reference for yourself is often your own notes and projects".

I will make a start to this project by making a cheatsheet for basic html tags and set up pages ready for cheatsheets on other topics. I aim to add a cheatsheet for most topics in respect of HTML and CSS initially, moving on to Javascript and eventually any other languages/technologies I learn. However, this may take some time as I am working on other projects simultaneously. 

I think this will be a very useful project to make sure I remember all the stuff I am learning. 

## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* Maybe some Javascript
